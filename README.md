InformTarget Survey: Share Your Experience and Get Rewarded

In today’s competitive retail world, customer feedback is more valuable than ever. Target, one of the most trusted retail brands, has created a simple and effective way to connect directly with its shoppers—the InformTarget survey at InformTarget.com.co. This platform allows every guest to share their shopping experience and play an active role in shaping the future of Target stores.

What is the InformTarget Survey?

The InformTarget survey is Target’s official guest satisfaction program. After making a purchase at any Target store, customers can use the code printed on their receipt to access the online survey. It only takes a few minutes to complete, but the insights collected help Target understand what is working well and where improvements are needed.

Why Your Feedback Matters

Every Target visit is unique. Some shoppers may notice excellent customer service, while others might suggest more product variety, faster checkout, or better store cleanliness. By collecting this information, Target can:

Improve customer service and staff training

Ensure shelves are stocked with the products customers love

Enhance the in-store and online shopping experience

Deliver on its promise of convenience and affordability

Rewards for Your Time

Target values every opinion and understands that customers’ time is important.
